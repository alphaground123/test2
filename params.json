We suppose that these particles are subject to gravity and other forces which we will detail in the file Particles.md.\r\n\r\nThe falling particles simulator considers as many particles as the user has decided to.\r\nIf the user enters a large number of particles, the more he will enter data.\r\nTherefore, I suggest beginning with two particles.\r\n\r\n## Supported platforms\r\n- Linux\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nThe FPS runs on Linux. Before using the FPS, make sure you have [Gnuplot] (http://www.gnuplot.info/) on your Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n#### Makefile\r\nOpen the terminal and type the command lines: <br />\r\nmake particles_simulator <br />\r\n./particles_simulator <br />\r\n\r\nTo plot the evolution in time of the falling rigid spherical particles, you need to run gnuplot and load the particles positions.\r\n\r\nCommand lines for gnuplot: <br />\r\ngnuplot <br />\r\nload 'positions.plt' <br />\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn the FPS, we distinguish two properties:\r\n- The simulation properties\r\n- The particle properties\r\n \r\nThe simulation properties are:\r\n- The number of particles\r\n- The total simulation time\r\n- The time step of the simulation\r\n\r\nThe particle properties are:\r\n- The radius of the particle\r\n- The mass of the particle\r\n- The coefficient of restitution to the impact\r\n- The friction coefficient\r\n- Its initial position\r\n- Its initial speed\r\n\r\nOnce the PFS has all the data, it will calculate all positions in the x, y and z axes of the particles over time.\r\nAll the x, y and z positions of each particle are stored in the .data files and some commands for gnuplot are generated in the file 'positions.plt' that will be created automatically.\r\n\r\nThen the user type in the terminal, the command \"gnuplot\" to call gnuplot, then load the file positions.plt by typing:\r\nload 'positions.plt'\r\n\r\nThe user can see the trajectory of each particle in space (see below).\r\n\r\n![tag image] (https://github.com/alphaground123/test2/blob/master/images/dix_particules.png)\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nWe set the following parameters for two particles, see the tables below: \r\n\r\n|Parameter name|Data|\r\n| :---: | :---: |\r\n| Number of particles | 2 |\r\n| Total simulation | 50 |\r\n|Time step|0.01|\r\n\r\n|Parameter name|Particle 1|Particle 2|\r\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| Radius | 0.05 | 0.08 |\r\n| Mass | 1 | 0.5 |\r\n|Coefficient of restitution|0.4|0.2|\r\n|Friction coefficient|0.4|0.8|\r\n|Initial position x|4|5|\r\n|Initial position y|4|5|\r\n|Initial position z|4|5|\r\n|Initial velocity Vx|1|2|\r\n|Initial velocity Vy|1|2|\r\n|Initial velocity Vz|1|2|\r\n\r\nSee [FPS Equations] (https://github.com/alphaground123/test2/blob/master/FPS_Equations.md)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the terminal:\r\n\r\n************ Welcome to the Falling Particle Simulator *************\r\n\r\nEnter the number of particles: 2 <br />\r\nEnter the total simulation time: 50 <br />\r\nEnter the time step of the simulation: 0.01 <br />\r\n\r\nEnter the radius of the particle 1: 0.05 <br />\r\nEnter the mass of

the particle 2: 0.08 <br />\r\nEnter the mass of the particle 2: 0.5 <br />\r\nEnter the coefficient of restitution of the impact of the particle 2: 0.2 <br />\r\nEnter the friction coefficient of the particle 2: 0.8 <br />\r\n\r\nEnter the initial position x of the particle 1: 4 <br />\r\nEnter the initial position y of the particle 1: 4 <br />\r\nEnter the initial position z of the particle 1: 4 <br />\r\n\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vx of the particle 1: 1 <br />\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vy of the particle is 1: 1 <br />\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vz of the particle 1: 1 <br />\r\n\r\nEnter the initial position x of the particle 2: 5 <br />\r\nEnter the initial position y of the particle 2: 5 <br />\r\nEnter the initial position z of the particle 2: 5 <br />\r\n\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vx of the particle 2: 2 <br />\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vy of the particle 2: 2 <br />\r\nEnter the initial velocity Vz of the particle 2: 2 <br />\r\n\r\nEnd of calculating positions, please call gnuplot and typing load 'positions.plt' to display the trajectory of each particle\r\n\r\nAnd we get the plot of the particles falls as shown below:\r\n\r\n![tag image]
